Better media management for WordPress. Upload, embed, and link to your files hosted on Live Editor directly in your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Upload, embed, and link to your files hosted on Live Editor directly in your WordPress site.

*  **HTML5 video and audio media encoding built in.** Your uploaded files are automatically encoded into the formats required for playback on all computers and mobile devices.
*  **Reliable cloud hosting.** All uploaded files are stored on and served from Amazon S3.
*  **Better organization and retrieval.** Organize your files into collections. Add basic metadata. Use our powerful built-in search engine to find what you're looking for.
*  **Automatically track your usage of files** when you add them to a post or page in WordPress. Then you'll know the full impact of uploading a new version or deleting the file later.
*  **Track sources and derivatives** for each file.
*  **Link up YouTube and Vimeo videos** to their source video files for easier retrieval and editing later.
*  **Seamless integration with WordPress.** We've taken great care to build this WordPress plugin with the same visual style and functionality that you'd expect from WordPress. You'll forget that you're using an external service while you're authoring your content.

**Note:** This plugin requires paid subscription to the [Live Editor File Manager](http://www.liveeditorcms.com/file-manager?utm_source=WordPress%2BPlugin%2BDirectory&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=WordPress%2BPlugin) service.

== Installation ==

First, install the Live Editor File Manager WordPress plugin:

1. Install the Live Editor plugin either via the WordPress.org plugin directory or by uploading the files to your server.
2. Activate the plugin in your WordPress dashboard.

= Configuration =

After installing the plugin, you need to do 4 more configurations, listed in the sections that follow.

**1. Live Editor account**

If you haven't already, you can sign up for an account at LiveEditorCMS.com.

**2. Account URL**

Each Live Editor account has an account URL that looks something like this:
https://**example**.liveeditorcms.com/

It's the URL that you use to sign in to your Live Editor account. You'll need to enter that into your WordPress settings.

Browse to your Live Editor File Manager settings in WordPress at Settings > File Manager. Then enter the subdomain for your Live Editor account into the Account Subdomain field.

**3. Account API key**

Each Live Editor account has an API key. If you are an account administrator for your Live Editor account, you can log in to Live Editor and generate a new API key from the Settings section.

1. Copy the API key from Live Editor.
2. Browse to your File Manager settings in WordPress at Settings > File Manager.
3. Paste the API key into the Account API Key field.

If you already have entered an API key, double-check that it matches the API key listed in your Live Editor account.

If you do not have access to your Live Editor and/or WordPress account settings, be sure to contact your account administrator for assistance.

**4. User API key**

Each user in Live Editor has an API key. Accordingly, each user in WordPress should have their own Live Editor user API key, and they will need to enter it into their WordPress profile settings.

You can log in to Live Editor and generate your own API key in your user profile section.

1. In the navigation bar, click your name and go to API Key.
2. Copy the API key.
3. Browse to your WordPress user profile settings by hovering over your name and clicking Edit My Profile.
4. Paste your user API key into the User API Key field at the bottom of the screen.

*  Live Editor is hosted on durable, secure, and reliable servers provided by Amazon Web Services. Specifically, all files uploaded to Live Editor are stored on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

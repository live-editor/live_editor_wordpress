Keep all of your media and files in one place: Live Editor File Manager. This plugin allows you to upload files into
and seemlessly load your files from Live Editor File Manager, all from your WordPress admin.

Live Editor allows more control over your images, videos, audio, fonts, and documents:

*  Serve your files from Amazon S3
*  All uploaded videos and audio are automatically transcoded into the formats required for HTML5
*  Categorize files into collections
*  Search your files by metadata and keywords
*  Track sources and derivatives for each file
*  Link up YouTube and Vimeo videos to their source video files for easier retrieval and editing later

**Note:** This plugin requires paid subscription to the [Live Editor File Manager](http://www.liveeditorcms.com/)
